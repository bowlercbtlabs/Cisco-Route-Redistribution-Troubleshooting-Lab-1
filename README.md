# Cisco Route Redistribution - Lab 1

## Trouble Ticket #1

### Problem
- After letting one of your Jr. Network Administrators perform Mutual Redistribution between OSPF and EIGRP on R2, you have noticed that R1 is not receiving all the routes learned from EIGRP on R3.

### Desired outcome
- Configure the network so that all the EIGRP networks on R3 show up in R1â€™s Routing table

## Trouble Ticket #2

### Problem
- After you have restored the above Task, users off the 10.0.1.0/24 network are complaining that they are not able to reach users off the 30.0.3.0/24 network.

### Desired outcome
- Configure the network so that users off the 10.0.1.0/24 network can successfully ping users off the 30.0.3.0/24 network.
